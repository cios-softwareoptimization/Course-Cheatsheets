# Course-Cheatsheets

## Main idea

The idea of this project is to store useful information about some technologies used on the course,
using in this case markdown. 

## Why do we do this?

Because not every student knows all the technologies, so the students can checkout information about
languages or technologies in a more easier way and thus everyone is on the same page, also if 
someone want to recap some concepts, that person can checkout the cheatsheets easily.
